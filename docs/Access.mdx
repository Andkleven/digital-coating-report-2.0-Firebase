# User Access

This document describes features with limited access and who has permission to use them.

_Note: All permission names are written in camelCase,
as they are imported automatically from the source code and
we want this to be readable for project administration as well as developers._

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

Most user access is decided on a general level (above project level),
with the exception of _offsite responsible_, which is decided on a project level.

Here's an example of what that could entail:  
An operator (without access to finished items) who is an offsite responsible
for a single project, will be able to see only that project's finished items in
the explorer and no other finished items.
